   The documentation that follows provides extracts from relevant sections of the `National PHN Guidance - Initial Assessment and Referral for Mental Health Care  <https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/2126B045A8DA90FDCA257F6500018260/$File/National%20MH-IAR%20Guidance-%2030Aug2019_V1.02%20Accessible.pdf>`_ which has been designed to assist the various parties involved in the referral and assessment process.

   This Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent evidence-
   informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be refined as
   new evidence emerges.
