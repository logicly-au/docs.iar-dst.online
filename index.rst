   This documentation provides extracts from relevant sections of the
   :download:`National PHN Guidance - Initial Assessment and Referral for Mental Health Care <National MH-IAR Guidance V1.05.pdf>`
   which has been designed to assist the various parties involved in the initial assessment and referral process.

   The Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent
   evidence-informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be
   refined as new evidence emerges.

   It is expected that PHNs will use the Guidance to:

      * Design initial assessment and referral processes for referrers and commissioned primary mental health care services.
      * Review existing initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned primary mental health care services.
      * Guide the development of referral pathways (e.g., Health Pathways).
      * Provide clear and consistent information to referrers, consumers, carers, and communities.
      * Instigate clinical governance policies and protocols to monitor the safety and quality of assessment and referral systems.

   Whilst this Guidance refers to the critical interface between primary mental health care and acute, tertiary
   and specialist secondary settings, this Guidance is not intended to be applied within acute or specialist
   mental health care settings. The Guidance has the potential to be used in private psychology and psychiatry
   services.
