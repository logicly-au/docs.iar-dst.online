   This Guidance is focussed on the initial response to requests for mental
   health assistance in primary care settings, and is designed to assist the
   various parties involved in the referral and assessment process.

   This Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent evidence-
   informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be refined as
   new evidence emerges.
