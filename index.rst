   This documentation provides extracts from relevant sections of the
   `National PHN Guidance - Initial Assessment and Referral for Mental Health Care  <https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/2126B045A8DA90FDCA257F6500018260/$File/National%20MH-IAR%20Guidance-%2030Aug2019_V1.02%20Accessible.pdf>`_
   which has been designed to assist the various parties involved in the referral and assessment process.

   The Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent
   evidence-informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be
   refined as new evidence emerges.

   It is expected that PHNs will use the Guidance to:

      * Design initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned
        primary mental health care services.
      * Review existing initial assessment and referral processes for
        commissioned primary mental health care services.
      * Guide the development of referral pathways (e.g., Health Pathways).
      * Provide clear and consistent information to referrers, consumers,
        carers and communities.
      * Instigate clinical governance policies and protocols to monitor the
        safety and quality of assessment and referral systems.

   Whilst the Guidance refers to the critical interface between primary mental
   health care and acute, tertiary and specialist secondary settings, it is not
   intended to be applied within acute or specialist mental health care
   settings. The Guidance has the potential to be used in private psychology
   and psychiatry services.
