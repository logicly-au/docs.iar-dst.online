Overview 
===========

The initial assessment domains 
---------------------------------------------

The initial assessment process recommended in this Guidance identifies eight domains that are assessed when determining the next steps in the referral process for an adolescent referred to a mental health service. The eight domains fall into two categories:

   * *Primary Assessment Domains (Domains 1 to 4)*: These domains cover symptoms severity and distress, risk of harm, functioning and impact of co-existing conditions. Primary Assessment Domains represent the basic areas for an initial assessment that have direct implications for decisions about the selection of a level of care.

   * *Contextual Domains (Domains 5 to 8)*: These domains cover service use and response history, social and environmental stressors, family and other supports, and engagement and motivation. Assessment on these domains provides essential context to moderate decisions indicated by the primary domains.

Initial assessment should consider the adolescent’s current situation on all eight domains. Each domain looks at specific factors relevant to making decisions about a level of care that is most likely suitable for adolescents' mental health treatment needs. The selection of the domains, and factors covered in each domain, aims to capture a limited number of key areas that a clinician would consider when determining the most appropriate services for an adolescent referred for mental healthcare.

Rating the initial assessment domains
----------------------------------------------------

A rating system grades each Domain on a 5-point rating scale of severity. While terms vary, the rating scale for each domain follows the general format:

   |   0 = No problem
   |
   |   1 = Mild problem
   |
   |   2 = Moderate problem
   |
   |   3 = Severe problem
   |
   |   4 = Very severe problem

Specific criteria are outlined for assessing each domain, designed to serve as a checklist of factors to consider when judging the extent to which a problem is present.



General Instructions for Rating the Domains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial assessment is undertaken across eight domains that describe clinical severity and service needs using a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4. Higher ratings indicate increased severity of the problem and the need for higher (more intensive) levels of care.

Each rating within each domain is defined by one or more descriptors designated by alpha characters (a, b, c etc.). Only one of these descriptors needs to be met for a rating to be selected for the adolescent.


Overarching Rules and Guides to Ratings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Unless stated otherwise, rate the adolescent’s current situation, defined as their most typical over the past month. This recognises that personal and social circumstances can change.

* Use all available information in making your rating. Information considered may include clinical interviews and input from the adolescent, the adolescent’s family, referrers, or other informants. Consider all reliable perspectives when selecting a rating (e.g., including information provided by the adolescent, parent/caregiver, referrer). 

* If more than one descriptor applies to the adolescent within each domain, the descriptor with the highest rating should be selected.

      * Example one: if 3-b, and 3-c apply, but 4-a is also present, the rating selected is 4.
      * Example two: if 2-a and 2-b apply, but 3-c is also present, the rating selected is 3.

* The coding of ratings as numerals is not intended to imply that an overall composite score can be used for making decisions about the adolescent’s service needs. The numbers should be regarded as just shorthand for summarising severity.

* Guidance is given for each domain on examples of problems that should be considered for specific ratings (the ‘descriptors’). Consider these as examples only rather than an exhaustive list of all factors relevant to the domain. Therefore, referring to the underlying rating format at times may be helpful.

* If there is uncertainty in the ratings, do not use the IAR-DST until you have sought additional information that will allow you to rate with certainty. Where uncertainty remains even after the additional information is obtained, the adolescent should be supported to access an appropriate clinician for a comprehensive assessment.

* The IAR-DST should not be used without clinical oversight and guides but does not replace clinical judgement. Systems and processes for initial assessment and referral should consider the unique and personal circumstances of the individual, including other health or social issues, their preferences and choices, and any risk or safety issues.

* The IAR-DST should not be used as a screening tool because it cannot be used without some form of personalised assessment.



.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Informed Consent
   :class: style-admonition

   Clinicians have legal and ethical obligations to obtain informed consent before performing any healthcare intervention for an adolescent. To give informed consent, a person (or the person making decisions for them if they cannot make decisions for themselves) must be sufficiently informed of the risks and benefits of any treatment (including, where relevant, the risk associated with no treatment).
   
   The process of gaining consent for the treatment of adolescents depends on whether they are a ‘mature minor’ or not. A mature minor is an adolescent assessed as having the capacity to make specific decisions based on various factors, including nature of the treatment, age, maturity, medical/social history, degree of independence, understanding, and intelligence. If an adolescent is a mature minor, consent for treatment is not required from a parent or guardian. 
   
   Depending on the circumstances, involvement of both the parent/guardian and adolescent in providing consent for the referral and intervention can be preferable. Where a parent or guardian gives consent on behalf of an adolescent for assessment and referral using the IAR-DST, efforts should be made to ensure the adolescent is as involved as possible in decision-making.
   
   Where on balance, the risk of engagement of the parent will lead to a potential negative impact on the adolescent, consideration may need to be given to the involvement of an alternative guardian if the adolescent is not a mature minor and cannot make treatment decisions for themselves. 
   
   Some states have specific legislation governing the informed consent of minors in healthcare. It is the responsibility of all healthcare providers to know and understand their legal obligations in whichever state or territory they are practising.
