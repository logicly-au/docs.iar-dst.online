Domain 5 - Service Use and Response History (Contextual Domain)
=================================================================



Overview
---------

This domain considers the adolescent and their family’s previous use of services and support focussed on mental health-related assistance for the adolescent. The initial assessment on this domain should consider:

   * Whether the adolescent/family has previously sought help from or required mental health services and related supports (including specialist or mental health inpatient services).
   
   * If the adolescent is currently engaged with services and support.

   * Their progress or benefit from past or current services and support.

**Definition of the term services and support** - Relevant services and support refer to developmentally and culturally appropriate evidence-informed mental health, health and community services focussed on or relevant to the adolescent’s mental health (such as a psychological service delivered by a GP or mental health professional, or behavioural services) rather than the personal supports provided by friends, family, or social networks. Consider both the adolescent and their family’s use of previous services and support but do not include those services and support relevant to, but not focused on, the adolescent's mental health.
