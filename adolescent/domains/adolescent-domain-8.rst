Domain 8 - Engagement and Motivation (Contextual Domain)
=========================================================

Overview
----------

This domain considers the adolescent or their parent/caregiver’s awareness of the mental health issue and their motivation to engage in or accept assistance. 

Many adolescents do not have the agency or resources required to seek and access services and support independently. Therefore the engagement and motivation of the parent/caregiver is the primary determinant of access and uptake, and the parent/caregiver sub-scale is used. Whilst the parent/caregiver sub-scale rates the engagement and motivation of the parent/caregivers, the adolescent should be included in discussions, using language they understand, and supported to express their choices, preferences, fears, and goals about referral next steps.

The parent/caregiver sub-scale is used when the adolescent cannot exercise decision-making control of their healthcare decisions. The parent/caregiver sub-scale considers:

   * The parent/caregiver’s awareness of the adolescent’s mental health issue.
   * The parent/caregiver’s capacity and willingness to support the adolescent to participate in the recommended services and support.
   
Conversely, where the adolescent can exercise decision-making control of their healthcare decisions, the adolescent's engagement and motivation take precedence (adolescent sub-scale). The adolescent sub-scale considers:

   * the adolescent’s capacity and willingness to participate in the recommended services and support.


.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Checking in when engagement or motivation is low
     
   A follow-up check-in helps determine if the recommended information, resources or services are utilised and perceived as helpful. Proactively “checking in” or encouraging the adolescent and parent/caregiver to “check back” is essential when engagement or motivation is low. A plan for check-in should be made at the point of referral and documented. 
   
   The check-in should explore the following questions: 
   
      1. Is the adolescent engaging with the recommended information, resources, and services? If the adolescent is not engaging, it is essential to re-examine motivation and explore reasons for lack of engagement. 
      2. Does the adolescent think that the recommended information, resources, and services are/were helpful?
      3. Is there evidence of deterioration or changing risk of suicide or harm to self or others?
      4. Is the adolescent experiencing new or worsening social and environmental stressors?
      5. Discuss and document the next steps determined in collaboration with the adolescent. The next steps might include:
      
         -	Continue existing service arrangements
         -	Build-in additional supports
         -	Initiate a referral to a different level of care
   

Scoring
--------

PARENT/CAREGIVER SUB-SCALE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Use the parent sub-scale where the adolescent cannot exercise decision-making control of their healthcare decisions.*

**0 = Optimal**

   a.	The parent/caregiver has a good awareness of the adolescent’s mental health issue and impacts and is motivated about and capable of participating fully in the recommended services and supports. 

**1 = Positive**

   a.	The parent/caregiver has a developing awareness of the adolescent’s mental health issue and impacts and is mostly capable of participating in the recommended services and supports. 

**2 = Limited or mixed**

   a.	The parent/caregiver has limited awareness of the adolescent’s mental health issue and is unsure whether they will participate in the recommended services and supports or has limited capacity to do so. 

   b.	There is significant divergence between the parents/caregivers in the level of engagement or motivation to participate in the recommended services and supports. 

**3 = Minimal**

   a.	The parent/caregiver cannot participate in the recommended services and support without considerable practical or emotional assistance. 

   b.	Despite the adolescent requiring them, the parent/caregiver has not facilitated access to services and supports in the past due to low engagement or motivation. 

**4 = Disengaged**

   a.	The parent/caregiver cannot support participation in services and supports or avoids potentially useful and available supports. 
   

ADOLESCENT SUB-SCALE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Use the adolescent sub-scale where the adolescent can exercise decision-making control of their healthcare decisions. In most instances, when working with a mature minor (see informed consent practice point above), the use of the adolescent sub-scale will be appropriate.*

**0 = Optimal**

   a.	The adolescent is motivated about participating in the recommended services and support. 

**1 = Positive**  

   a.	The adolescent is mostly willing to accept and participate in the recommended services and support. 

**2 = Limited**

   a.	The adolescent is hesitant to accept and participate in the recommended services and support. 

**3 = Minimal**

   a.	The adolescent is very reluctant to accept or participate in services and support.

   b.	The adolescent has not participated in services and support in the past, despite requiring them, due to low levels of engagement or motivation. 

**4 = Disengaged**

   a.	The adolescent refuses to accept or participate in the recommended services and support.
