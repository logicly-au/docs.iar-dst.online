Domain 3 - Functioning (Primary Domain)
========================================


Overview
---------

This domain considers functional impairment caused by or exacerbated by mental health issues. While some types of disabilities being experienced by the adolescent may play a role in determining what types of support services may be required, they should generally not be considered in determining mental health service intensity within a stepped care continuum.

Assessment of an adolescent on this domain should consider the impact of the mental health issues on:

   * The adolescents’ ability to fulfil usual roles/responsibilities appropriate to their age, developmental level, and cultural background.
   * The adolescent’s functioning within the family or home environment, in educational or vocational settings, with friends and peers, and in the community.
   * The adolescent’s ability to undertake basic activities of daily living appropriate to their age and developmental level (e.g., self-care, mobility, toileting, feeding, and personal hygiene).



Scoring
---------

**0 = No problems in this domain – no descriptors apply**

**1 = Mild impact**

   a.	Mildly diminished ability to function in one or more of their usual roles (e.g., at home, in educational or vocational settings, with friends and peers, and in the community), but without significant or adverse consequences.

   b.	Mental health issues contribute to brief and transient disruptions in one or more areas of functioning.

**2 = Moderate impact**

   a.	Moderate functional impairment in more than one of their usual roles (e.g., at home, in educational or vocational settings, with friends and peers, and in the community) to the extent that they are reasonably frequently unable to meet the requirements of those roles.

   b.	Mental health issues contribute to occasional difficulties with basic activities of daily living but without threat to health.

**3 = Severe impact**

   a.	Significant difficulties with functioning, resulting in disruption to many areas of the adolescent’s life most of the time (e.g., limited participation in educational or vocational activities, deterioration in or some withdrawal from relationships with friends and peers), but the adolescent can function independently with adequate treatment, family, and community support.

   b.	Mental health issues contribute to difficulties with basic self-care (hygiene, eating, appearance) on a frequent, consistent basis but without threat to health.

**4 = Very severe to extreme impact**

   a.	Profound difficulties with functioning, resulting in major disruption to virtually all areas of the adolescent’s life (e.g., unable to participate in educational or vocational activities, complete withdrawal from friends and peers).

   b.	Mental health issues contribute to severe and persistent self-neglect that poses a threat to health.
