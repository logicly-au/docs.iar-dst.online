Domain 2 - Risk of Harm (Primary Domain)
=========================================

Overview
---------

This domain considers the adolescent’s potential to harm themselves or others or be harmed by others.

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Risk of harm

   Risk of harm must be considered in the context of information gathered on the other seven domains- information gathered across the other seven domains (e.g., if the person is experiencing loneliness or significant environmental stressors) is very important in evaluating harm.

Recent Australian and international evidence indicates that suicide risk prediction is a flawed, imprecise, and misleading activity in mental healthcare that contributes to over and underprediction of suicide risk. 

This domain is not about predicting the adolescents likely to attempt or die by suicide or undertake other forms of harm. Instead, it should be used to guide the evaluation of current risk to inform the most appropriate response or referral. This domain is focused on examining:

   * Suicidality – current and past suicidal ideation and attempts.
   * Intentional, non-suicidal self-harm – current and past.
   * Impulsive, dangerous or risky behaviours with the potential for harm to self or others (consider and include risks associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs).
   * The harm caused by abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others (harm from others).
   * Unintentional harm to self or others arising from severe symptoms or self-neglect.


.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Assessment of adolescents with a suicide attempt history but no current suicidal indicators
   
   While any history of a suicide attempt is a risk factor for a subsequent attempt, several factors elevate this risk. These factors include:
   
      1. When the previous suicide attempt occurred: the risk of re-attempting suicide remains high throughout a person’s life but is particularly high in the 12-months following an attempt. 
      
      2. The lethality of the previous attempt: the method, medical seriousness, rescuability, and physical consequences of the attempt all contribute to assessing potential lethality. A previous attempt with higher lethality is associated with an increased risk of a subsequent attempt. 
   
      3. Post-attempt aftercare services: a person’s participation in high-quality post-attempt aftercare services is associated with a decreased risk of a subsequent suicide attempt.
   
   The factors contributing to a person attempting or dying by suicide are complex and highly variable. A previous suicide attempt is considered a risk factor – however, some people who attempt suicide may never again experience suicidal thinking or behaviours. 
   
   An adolescent who has previously attempted suicide is rated at minimum as a 2 (moderate risk) on this domain - or higher if there are current suicidal behaviours. A rating of 2 on Domain 2 is aligned with Level 3 care and above. This rating will help to ensure a comprehensive mental health assessment is made available (a core feature of all Level 3 services). Following a comprehensive mental health assessment, the clinician can consider the suitability of lower-intensity interventions (Level 1/Level 2).
   

*The IAR adaptation for adolescents includes the* **risk of harm from others** *others in Domain 2 because there are direct implications for the intensity of mental health response an adolescent at risk of or experiencing harm from others is likely to require. Placing risk of harm from others in another domain (e.g., Domain 6) does not carry the same weight within the logic that underpins the recommendations about a level of care. Note that the presence of external stressors (e.g., domestic violence, bullying) is rated at Domain 6 but the degree of risk of harm arising from those stressors is rated separately at Domain 2.*

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Mandatory reporting

   Mandatory reporting laws aim to identify adolescents at risk, including abuse and neglect incidents, and protect the individual adolescents involved. The laws require selected groups of people to report suspected child abuse and neglect to government authorities. Laws exist in all Australian jurisdictions. However, the laws are not the same across all jurisdictions. Differences exist in who must report, the nature of risks and incidents that must be reported, and to who the report is made. 
   
   It is important to note that any person is lawfully entitled to make a report if they are concerned for an adolescent's welfare, even if they are not required to do so as a mandatory reporter.
   
   Users of the IAR-DST should be familiar with signs of abuse and neglect and their legal responsibilities regarding mandatory reporting.

Scoring
--------

**0 = No problems in this domain **

**1 = Low risk of harm**

   a. No current suicidal ideation, but the adolescent has experienced ideation, intent, or plans in the past unrelated to the current episode or current life stressors.

   b.	Occasional non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and not requiring any medical treatment.

   c.	May have engaged in past behaviours that posed a risk to self or others, but no current or recent instances.

   d.	Currently at low risk of harm from abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others.
    
**2 = Moderate risk of harm**

   a.	Current suicidal ideation, without plan or intent. But may have had intent, plans, or attempts in the past unrelated to the current episode or current life stressors.

   b.	Previous suicide attempt (longer than 12 months ago) but no current intent, plan, or ideation.

   c.	Frequent non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and not requiring any medical treatment.

   d.	Current or recent behaviours that pose a non-life-threatening risk to self or others.

   e.	Currently at some risk of harm from abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others.

   f.	Intermittent lapses in self-care that may lead to harm.
   

**3 = High risk of harm**

   a.	Current suicidal ideation with intent. May have history of suicide attempt. No plan or strong reluctance to carry out the plan, strong protective factors, and a commitment to engage in a safety plan, including involvement of family, significant others, and services.

   b.	Recent suicide attempt (within past 12 months) but no current intent, plan, or ideation.

   c.	Frequent non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and requiring medical treatment.

   d.	Recent or current impulsive, dangerous, or risky behaviours to self or others that have had or are likely to have a serious impact. 

   e.	Significant risk of, or recent experience of, abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others. 

   f.	Clearly compromised self-care ability that is ongoing to the extent that indirect or unintentional harm to self is likely. 
   
**4 = Very high risk of harm***

    a.	Recent suicide attempt (within past 12 months) or current suicidal ideation with intent, plan and means to carry out. Few or no protective factors.

    b.	History of life-threatening self-injurious acts that are prominent in the current presentation. 

    c.	There is evidence of current severe symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, avoidant behaviour, paranoia, disordered thinking, delusions, impulsivity) with behaviour that is likely to present an imminent or unpredictable danger to self or others.

    d.	Extremely compromised self-care ability to the extent that there is a real and present danger of the adolescent experiencing harm related to these deficits. 

    e.	Life-threatening medical risks and complications associated with an eating disorder.
