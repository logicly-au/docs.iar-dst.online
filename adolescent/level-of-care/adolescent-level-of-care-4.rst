Level 4 - High Intensity Services
===================================

Definition
-----------

High-intensity services include periods of intensive service that usually involve multi-disciplinary support and family-focused care coordination as multiple services are likely to be involved. Level 4 is usually designed to support adolescents experiencing severe symptoms, significant functional impairment or risk factors.

Care environment
-----------------

Typically, face-to-face services in community locations (e.g., consulting rooms) or outreach to the adolescent and family within their home or other environments (including school, vocational settings, community services, and general practice). 

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all adolescents suited to this level of care.

   * GP mental health assessment (and development of a MHTP).
   * Evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe psychological services provided by a mental health professional.
   * Community psychiatry - psychiatrist opinion, referral, management plan and treatment. 
   * Diagnosis specific services where indicated (e.g., eating disorder clinics, alcohol, and other drug services, services for adolescents with at-risk mental states like psychosis). 
   * School and vocational supports to minimise functional impairment and maximise functional recovery.


Other clinical services that may be required
----------------------------------------------

   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs.
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.
   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 

Support services
-----------------

Additional services are likely to be needed and may include: 

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the well-being of the adolescent.
   * Peer support for the adolescent, parents/caregivers, and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focussed care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the adolescent and family.
    
If needed, additional services are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the adolescent and family relevant to the well-being of the adolescent, including school-based and community-based supports, housing, legal, financial, and other supports.


   
Referral criteria
-------------------

An adolescent requiring this level of care usually has significant symptoms or significant problems with Functioning. An adolescent with a severe presentation is likely to be experiencing moderate or higher problems associated with risk of harm, functioning, and impact of co-existing conditions. Where problems are assessed as very severe in symptom severity and distress, risk of harm, or functioning domains, a referral to Level 5 care should be considered.
