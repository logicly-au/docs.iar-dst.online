Level 1 - Self Management
===========================

Definition
------------

Services at this level provide self-help resources to support the adolescent in managing any distress or symptoms and maintaining functioning without the direct involvement of a mental health professional. A younger adolescent may require assistance, prompting and encouragement from a parent/caregiver or other key supports (e.g., teacher) to engage with and understand self-management recommendations. 

This level of care generally involves evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe online resources and other forms of self-help. A summary of the evidence-based online mental health resources and self-help services is available through the `Head to Health website <https://www.headtohealth.gov.au/supporting-yourself/support-for/young-people>`_.


Care environment
------------------

Services are easily accessible and available online, via telephone or in the community. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., schools, vocational settings, and general practice).

Core clinical services
-----------------------

This level of care focuses on resources that can be accessed and self-managed by the adolescent or their parent(s)/caregiver(s). Clinical services are generally not required; however, where they are involved, they should include:

   * Psychoeducation (written and verbal forms), social prescribing, and information via a GP for both the adolescent and parent/caregivers. The GP may also consider developing a Mental Health Treatment Plan (MHTP) (if consistent with Medicare Benefits Schedule eligibility requirements).
   * Wellbeing and preventative programs within the school, vocational or other community settings.
   * Be focussed on monitoring, with the capability to step up into a higher level of care if required.

Other clinical services that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs. 
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.
   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 


Support services
------------------

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the well-being of the adolescent.
   * Peer support for the adolescent, parents/caregivers, and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focused care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the adolescent and family). 

Additional services, if needed, are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the adolescent and family, relevant to the adolescentâ€™s wellbeing, including school-based and community-based housing, legal, financial, and other supports.


Referral criteria
-------------------

An adolescent suitable for this level of care typically has minimal or no risk factors, are usually experiencing mild symptoms/low levels of distress. Where distress is present, this is likely to be in response to a stressful environment. Symptoms have typically been present for a short time (less than three months, but this may vary). Where the adolescent has accessed services before, they are likely to have had a moderate to excellent response to the previous service experience. The adolescent is generally functioning well and should be motivated to pursue self-management options. An adolescent experiencing a lack of motivation/engagement should not be referred to this level of care because these problems will work against involvement in self-management strategies.
