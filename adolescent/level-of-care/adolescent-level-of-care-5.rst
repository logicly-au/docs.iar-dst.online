Level 5 - Acute and Specialist Community Mental Health Services
================================================================

Definition
------------

Specialist mental healthcare usually includes intensive team-based specialist assessment and service (typically state/territory mental health services) with involvement from a range of different types of mental health professionals, including case managers, psychiatrists, social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists and drug and alcohol workers. This level also often includes more intensive care provided by GPs working with acute and specialist teams. 

Care environment
-----------------

Typically, community locations with outreach to adolescents within their home or other environments. This level may also involve specialist mental health inpatient care within a hospital environment, community-based intermediate care, sub-acute unit, or crisis respite centre. 

Core clinical services
------------------------

For this level of care, the adolescent and family are likely to benefit from psychiatric assessment and care, specialist behavioural programs, crisis management, and therapeutic services using pro-active engagement strategies provided by a multi-disciplinary specialist team with outreach capability. Care should be provided in close collaboration with General Practice.

Additional services are likely to be needed and may include: 

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the well-being of the adolescent.
   * Peer support for the adolescent, parents/caregivers, and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs.
   * Family-focussed care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the adolescent and family. 
   
If needed, additional services are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the adolescent and family relevant to the well-being of the adolescent, including school-based and community-based supports, housing, legal, financial, and other supports.
