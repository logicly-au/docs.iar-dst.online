Welcome to the Initial Assessment and Referral Decision Support Tool (IAR-DST) for mental health. The IAR-DST is designed for use by Australian health professionals when a person presents with mental health related needs in the Australian primary care system. The IAR is intended to assist Australian health professionals to decide the highest level of care a patient will need across five levels of care in an Australian stepped care model.

* "You" and "Your" refer to the user of the IAR-DST and **Guidance Documentation**.
