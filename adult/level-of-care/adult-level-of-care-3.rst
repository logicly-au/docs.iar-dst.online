Level 3 - Moderate Intensity Services
=======================================


Definition
-----------

Moderate intensity services generally provide structured, reasonably frequent, and intensive
interventions (e.g., a defined number of psychological sessions delivered regularly). 

Care environment
------------------

Typically, community locations (e.g., consulting rooms), outreach into residential
environments (e.g., aged care facilities, schools) or if appropriate, via telephone or videoconference (e.g., for
people in remote communities), and clinician assisted e-therapies.

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive psychological assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all individuals suited to this level of care.

   * Evidence-based psychological interventions provided by a mental health clinician.

   * Active GP management, mental health assessment (and development of a MHTP).


Other clinical interventions that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * community based psychiatry.

   * clinical care coordination services within primary care (if more than 2 services are involved in providing care).


Support services
------------------

Additional services, if needed, are focussed on:

   * community supports (including peer support and social participation support).

   * assistance to access support and advice relating to known environmental stressors.

   * lifestyle interventions (e.g., nutrition, sleep, exercise, meaningful social connections).

Referral criteria
-------------------

A person requiring this level of care is likely to be experiencing mild to moderate symptoms/distress (that
would meet criteria for a diagnosis). Symptoms have *typically* been present for 6 months or more (but this
may vary). Initial assessment would usually indicate problems present in risk of harm, functioning or impact
of co-existing conditions but not at very severe levels, which should trigger consideration of a referral to
Level 5. People experiencing moderate to severe symptoms with mild to moderate problems associated with
Risk, Functioning and Impact of Co-existing Conditions are usually suitable for this level of care.

Using the Initial Assessment Rating Glossary to support decision making
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals suited to this level of care may have been rated during the initial assessment as having:

   * Mild or lesser *Symptom Severity and Distress* (score ≤ 1) but with complexity indicated by significant problems on *Risk of Harm* or *Functioning* (scores ≥ 2) or *Impact of Co-existing Conditions* (score ≥ 2)

   **OR**

   * Moderate *Symptom Severity and Distress* (score = 2) with associated moderate or higher problems on any other Primary Domain (*Risk of Harm*, *Functioning*, *Impact of Co-existing Conditions*, scores ≥ 2) 

   **OR**

   * Severe *Symptom Severity and Distress* (score = 3) but problems on all other Primary Domain (*Risk of Harm*, *Functioning*, *Impact of Co-existing Conditions*) are mild or less (all scores ≤ 1).
