Children (5-11 years)
=============================


This documentation provides extracts from relevant sections of the 
`National PHN Guidance - Initial Assessment and Referral for Mental Health Care; Section 2 Child Lift Out (5-11 years) (to be published) <https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/primary-health-networks-phn-collection-of-primary-mental-health-care-resources?utm_source=health.gov.au&utm_medium=callout-auto-custom&utm_campaign=digital_transformation>`_ which has been designed to assist general practitioners and clinicians to recommend the most appropriate level of care for a child aged 5-11 years seeking or requiring mental health support. 

Whilst the Guidance uses age to indicate the overall appropriateness of each tool, the final decision about the most appropriate version is based on the clinical judgment of the user, taking into account contextual and developmental considerations.
