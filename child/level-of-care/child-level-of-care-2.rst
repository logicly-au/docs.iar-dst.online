Level 2 - Low Intensity Services
=================================


Definition
-----------

Low-intensity services are designed to be accessed quickly (without the need for a formal referral, e.g., through a third-party service or provider), easily (through a range of modalities including face-to-face, group work, telephone, and online services) and typically involve few or short sessions. In contrast to Level 1, Low-Intensity Services usually require some direct, individually tailored engagement with a mental health professional to support the child and their parent/caregiver. 

Care environment
------------------

Services are easily accessible and available online, over the telephone or in the community. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., schools, community services, and general practice).


Core clinical services
------------------------

   * Psychoeducation (written and verbal forms) and information via a GP for both the child and parent/caregivers. The GP may also consider developing a MHTP (if consistent with Medicare Benefits Schedule eligibility requirements).
   * Evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe low-intensity services (including online, telephone and face-to-face low-intensity psychological services or brief service engagement delivered by mental health professionals). Includes both individual and group work. 
   * School supports. 
   * Active involvement and input from a paediatrician. 


Other clinical services that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 
   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs. 
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.


Support services
------------------

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the child's wellbeing.
   * Peer support for parents/caregivers and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focussed care coordination services if more than two services provide care and support to the child and family.

If needed, additional services are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the child and family relevant to the well-being of the child, including school-based and community-based supports, housing, legal, financial, and other supports.


Referral criteria
------------------

A child suitable for this level of care typically has minimal or no risk factors and is usually experiencing mild symptoms/low levels of distress. Where present, this is likely to be in response to a stressful environment. Symptoms have typically been present for a short time (less than three months, but this may vary). The child is generally functioning well but may have problems with motivation or engagement or limited/minimal/no family and other supports â€“ both of which contraindicate a referral to Level 1 care. 

Complexity indicated by significant problems in risk of harm, functioning or co-existing conditions should be considered contraindications for referral to Level 2 care and trigger a referral to Level 3 or higher.
