Level 4 - High Intensity Services
===================================

Definition
-----------

High-intensity services include periods of intensive service that usually involve multi-disciplinary support and family-focused care coordination as multiple services are likely to be involved. Level 4 is usually designed to support children experiencing severe symptoms, significant functional impairment or risk factors.

Care environment
-----------------

Typically, face-to-face services in community locations (e.g., consulting rooms) or outreach to the child and family within their home or other environment (including school, community services, and general practice). 

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all children suited to this level of care.

   * GP mental health assessment (and development of a MHTP).
   * Evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe psychological services provided by a mental health professional.
   * Community psychiatry - psychiatrist opinion, referral, management plan and treatment. 
   * Diagnosis specific services where indicated (e.g., eating disorder services). 
   * School support to minimise functional impairment and maximise functional recovery.
   * Active involvement and input from a paediatrician. 

Other clinical services that may be required
----------------------------------------------

   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 
   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs.
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.


Support services
-----------------

Additional services are likely to be needed and may include: 

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school support relevant to the child's wellbeing.
   * Peer support for parents/caregivers and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focussed care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the child or family).

   
Referral criteria
-------------------

A child requiring this level of care usually has significant symptoms or significant problems with functioning. A child with a severe presentation is likely to be experiencing moderate or higher problems associated with risk of harm, functioning and impact of co-existing conditions. Where problems are assessed as very severe in symptom, risk of harm or functioning domains, a referral to Level 5 care should be considered.
