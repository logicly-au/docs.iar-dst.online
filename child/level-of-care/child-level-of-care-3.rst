Level 3 - Moderate Intensity Services
=======================================


Definition
-----------

Moderate-intensity services generally provide structured, reasonably frequent, and individually tailored service delivery (e.g., a defined number of psychological sessions delivered regularly). 

Care environment
------------------

Typically, community locations (e.g., consulting rooms, outreach into schools) or, if appropriate, via telephone or videoconference (e.g., for people in remote communities), and clinician assisted e-therapies. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., schools, community services, and general practice).

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all children suited to this level of care.

   * GP mental health assessment (and development of a MHTP).
   * Evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe psychological services.
   * Diagnosis specific services where indicated (e.g., eating disorder services). 
   * School supports to minimise functional impairment and maximise functional recovery.
   * Active involvement and input from a paediatrician. 



Other clinical services that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 
   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs. 
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.
   * Community psychiatry - psychiatrist opinion and management plan 


Support services
------------------

Additional services are likely to be needed and may include: 

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the well-being of the child
   * Peer support for parents/caregivers and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focussed care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the child or family).

If needed, additional services are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the child and family relevant to the well-being of the child, including school-based and community-based supports, housing, legal, financial, and other supports.


Referral criteria
-------------------

A child requiring this level of care is likely to be experiencing mild to moderate symptoms (that would likely meet the criteria for a diagnosis). Symptoms have typically been present for three months or more (but this may vary). The initial assessment would usually indicate problems present in risk of harm, functioning or impact of co-existing conditions but not at very severe levels, which should trigger consideration of a referral to Level 5. A child experiencing moderate to severe symptoms with mild to moderate problems associated with risk of harm, functioning and impact of co-existing conditions is usually suitable for this level of care.
