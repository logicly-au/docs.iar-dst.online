Level 1 - Self Management
===========================

Definition
------------

Services at this level provide self-help resources to parents/caregivers and other key supports (e.g., teachers) to support the child in managing any distress or symptoms and maintain functioning without the direct involvement of a mental health professional. Where resources are directed at the child, the child will likely require considerable parent/caregiver assistance and encouragement to engage with and understand self-management recommendations.  

This level of care generally involves evidence-informed, developmentally appropriate, and culturally safe online resources and other forms of self-help. A summary of the evidence-based online mental health resources and self-help services is available through the `Head to Health website <https://www.headtohealth.gov.au/supporting-yourself/support-for/young-people>`_.

Resources that promote positive child mental health are also likely to be appropriate (e.g., resources focused on developing routines, child-led play, etc.). 

Care environment
------------------

Services are easily accessible and available online, via telephone or in the community. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., schools and general practice).

Core clinical services
-----------------------

This level of care focuses on resources that can be accessed and self-managed by the parents/caregivers and the child but may also include support from another person (e.g., a teacher). Clinical services are generally not required; however, where they are involved, they should include:

   * Psychoeducation (written and verbal forms), social prescribing, and information via a GP for both the child and parent/caregivers. The GP may also consider developing a Mental Health Treatment Plan (MHTP)  (if consistent with Medicare Benefits Schedule eligibility requirements).
   * Wellbeing and preventative programs within the school or other community setting.
   * Be focussed on monitoring, with the capability to step up into a higher level of care if required.
   * Active involvement and input from a paediatrician. 


Other clinical services that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * Parenting programs and family-focused wellbeing programs. 
   * Family-focussed education or family therapy.
   * Lifestyle supports (e.g., sleep hygiene, social exercise programs). 


Support services
------------------

   * Specific community, social, recreational, and school supports relevant to the well-being of the child
   * Peer support for parents/caregivers and other family members.
   * Services and support focussed on connections with community and culture. 
   * Family-focussed care coordination services (if more than two services provide care and support to the child and family).

If needed, additional services are focused on advocating for and coordinating additional services and support required by the child and family relevant to the well-being of the child, including school-based and community-based supports, housing, legal, financial, and other supports.



Referral criteria
-------------------

A child suitable for this level of care typically has minimal or no risk factors are usually experiencing mild symptoms/low levels of distress. Where distress is present, this is likely to be in response to a stressful environment. Symptoms have typically been present for a short time (less than three months, but this may vary). The child is generally functioning well. Where the child has accessed services before, they are likely to have had a moderate to excellent response to the previous service experience.

The parent/caregiver should be motivated to pursue self-management options. Children with parents/caregivers experiencing a lack of motivation/engagement should not be referred to this level of care because these problems will work against involvement in self-management strategies.
