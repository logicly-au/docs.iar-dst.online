Domain 2 - Risk of Harm (Primary Domain)
=========================================

Overview
---------

This domain considers the child’s potential to harm themselves or others or be harmed by others.

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Risk of harm

   Risk of harm must be considered in the context of information gathered on the other seven domains- information gathered across the other seven domains (e.g., if the person is experiencing loneliness or significant environmental stressors) is very important in evaluating harm.

Recent Australian and international evidence indicates that suicide risk prediction is a flawed, imprecise, and misleading activity in mental healthcare that contributes to over and underprediction of suicide risk.

This domain is not about predicting the children that are likely to attempt or die by suicide or undertake other forms of harm. Instead, it should be used to guide the evaluation of current risk to inform the most appropriate response or referral. This domain is focused on examining:

   * Suicidality – current and past suicidal ideation and attempts.
   * Intentional, non-suicidal self-harm – current and past.
   * Impulsive, dangerous or risky behaviours with the potential for harm to self or others (consider and include risks associated with the use of alcohol and other drugs).
   * The harm caused by abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others (harm from others).
   * Unintentional harm to self or others arising from severe symptoms or self-neglect.

*The IAR adaptation for children includes the **risk of harm from others** in Domain 2 because there are direct implications for the intensity of mental health response a child at risk of or experiencing harm from others is likely to require. Placing risk of harm from others in another domain (e.g., Domain 6) does not carry the same weight within the logic that underpins the recommendations about a level of care. Note that the presence of external stressors (e.g., domestic violence, bullying) is rated at Domain 6 but the degree of risk of harm arising from those stressors is rated separately at Domain 2.*

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Mandatory reporting

   Mandatory reporting laws aim to identify children at risk, including abuse and neglect incidents, and protect the individual children involved. The laws require selected groups of people to report suspected child abuse and neglect to government authorities. Laws exist in all Australian jurisdictions. However, the laws are not the same across all jurisdictions. Differences exist in who must report, the nature of risks and incidents that must be reported, and to who the report is made. 
   
   It is important to note that any person is lawfully entitled to make a report if they are concerned for a child’s welfare, even if they are not required to do so as a mandatory reporter.
   
   Users of the IAR-DST should be familiar with signs of abuse and neglect and their legal responsibilities regarding mandatory reporting.

Scoring
--------

**0 = No identified risk in this domain – no descriptors apply**

**1 = Low risk of harm**

   a. No current suicidal ideation, but the child may have experienced suicidal ideation in the past (with no previous intent, plans, or attempts).

   b.	Occasional non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and not requiring any medical treatment.

   c.	May have engaged in past behaviours that posed a risk to self or others, but no current or recent instances.

   d.	Currently at low risk of harm from abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others.


**2 = Moderate risk of harm**

   a. Previous suicide attempt (more than 12 months ago) but no current ideation, intent, or plan.

   b.	Frequent non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and not requiring any medical treatment.

   c.	Current or recent behaviours that pose a non-life-threatening risk to self or others.

   d.	Currently at some risk of harm from abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others.

   e.	Intermittent lapses in self-care that may lead to harm.


**3 = High risk of harm**

   a. Current suicidal ideation but no current intent and no history of suicide attempts. No plan or strong reluctance to carry out the plan, strong protective factors, and a commitment to engage in a safety plan, including involvement of family, significant others, and services. 

   b.	Recent suicide attempt (within past 12-months) but no current ideation, intent, or plan.

   c.	Frequent non-suicidal self-injurious acts in the recent past and requiring medical treatment.

   d.	Recent or current impulsive, dangerous, or risky behaviours to self or others that have had or are likely to have a serious impact. 

   e.	Significant risk of, or recent experience of, abuse, exploitation, or neglect by others. 

   f.	Clearly compromised self-care ability that is ongoing to the extent that indirect or unintentional harm to self is likely. 


**4 = Very high risk of harm**

   a. Current suicidal ideation with plan, intent, or history of previous attempt. 

   b.	History of life-threatening self-injurious acts that are prominent in the current presentation. 

   c.	There is evidence of current severe symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, avoidant behaviour, paranoia, disordered thinking, delusions, impulsivity) with behaviour that is likely to present an imminent or unpredictable danger to self or others.

   d.	Extremely compromised self-care ability to the extent that there is a real and present danger of the child experiencing harm related to these deficits. 

   e.	Life-threatening medical risks and complications associated with an eating disorder.
