Domain 8 - Engagement and Motivation (Contextual Domain)
=========================================================

Overview
----------

This domain considers the parent/caregiver awareness of the mental health issue and their motivation to engage in or accept assistance. Children do not have the agency or resources required to seek services and support independently. Therefore, the parent/caregiver's engagement and motivation are the focus of this domain for children.

Whilst this domain rates the engagement and motivation of the parent/caregivers, the child should be included in discussions, using language they understand, and supported to express their choices, preferences, fears, and goals about referral next steps. 


.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Checking in when engagement or motivation is low
     
   A follow-up check-in helps determine if the recommended information, resources, or services are being utilised and perceived as helpful. Proactively “checking in” or encouraging the parent/caregiver to “check back” is essential when engagement or motivation is low. A plan for check-in should be made at the point of referral and documented. 
   The check-in should explore the following questions: 
   
      1. Is the parent/caregiver engaging with the recommended information, resources, or services? If the parent/caregiver is not engaging, it is essential to re-examine motivation and explore reasons for the lack of engagement.
      2. Is the child engaging with the recommended information, resources, or services? If the child is not engaging, it is essential to re-examine motivation and explore reasons for the lack of engagement.
      3. Does the child and their parent/caregiver think that the recommended information, resources, or services are/were helpful?
      4. Is there evidence of deterioration or changing risk of suicide or harm to self or others?
      5. Is the child or family experiencing new or worsening social and environmental stressors?
      6. Discuss and document the next steps determined in collaboration with the parent/caregiver and child. The next steps might include:
         
         -	Continue existing service arrangements
         -	Build-in additional supports
         -	Initiate a referral to a different level of care
