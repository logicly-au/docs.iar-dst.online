Domain 1 - Symptom Severity and Distress (Primary Domain)
=========================================================

Overview
--------

The severity of current symptoms and associated levels of distress are important factors in recommending a level of care and making a referral decision. 

This domain considers symptoms to include both internalised (emotional) problems experienced by the child (e.g., anxiety and depressive symptoms) as well as externalised behaviours observable by or impacting on others (e.g., poor impulse control, aggressive outbursts). 

Symptoms may be associated with distress, but this is not always the case. Symptoms may indicate a particular diagnostic condition, but a diagnosis is not required.

Assessment of a child on this domain should consider:

   * Current and past symptoms and duration.
   * Level of distress attributable to the mental health issues.
   * Previous experience of a mental health condition.
   * Are symptoms improving/worsening, is distress improving/worsening, and are new symptoms emerging?

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Eating disorders
   
   Eating disorders are mental illnesses accompanied by physical and mental health complications which may be severe and life-threatening. A person with an eating disorder can experience disturbances in behaviours, thoughts and feelings towards body weight/shape and/or food and eating. A person with symptoms suggestive of an eating disorder requires a comprehensive eating disorders assessment and referral to appropriate services according to a personâ€™s needs. 

   IAR-DST users should be familiar with their local eating disorder screening and assessment pathway. Contact the GP for care instructions in the absence of a defined local pathway.

Scoring
-------

**0 = No problem in this domain**

**1 = Mild - symptoms are likely to be sub-diagnostic and have been experienced for less than three months (but this may vary)**

   a.	Mild anxiety-related symptoms (e.g., fear, worry, difficulty concentrating without significant avoidant behaviour, body image issues, occasional unexplained somatic symptoms like headache and stomach pain).

   b.	Mild mood-related symptoms (e.g., sadness, fatigue, apathy, some reluctance to participate in previously enjoyed activities, irritability, occasional disrupted sleep).

   c.	Mild behavioural symptoms (e.g., distractibility, overactive, difficulty completing tasks, loses temper, oppositional, interpersonal difficulties).

   d.	Other mental health condition associated with mild distress. 
   


**2 = Moderate - symptoms are at a level that would likely meet diagnostic criteria and have been experienced for more than three months (but this may vary)**

   a.	Moderate anxiety-related symptoms (e.g., excessive worry, agitation, panic, difficulty concentrating with significant avoidant behaviour, overly concerned about body image or weight, extreme shyness, frequent unexplained somatic symptoms like headache and stomach pain).

   b.	Moderate mood-related symptoms (e.g., excessive sadness, apathy, exhaustion, frequent irritability, loss of interest and pleasure, frequent reluctance to participate in previously enjoyed, frequent sleep disturbance). 

   c.	Moderate behavioural symptoms (e.g., impulsivity,  hyperactivity, defying age-appropriate rules or social norms, significant difficulty getting along with others, angry or aggressive outbursts). 

   d.	Other mental health condition associated with moderate levels of distress.

   e.	History of a diagnosed mental health condition earlier in childhood that has not responded to treatment, with continuing symptoms but only causing low to moderate levels of distress. 
   


**3 = Severe**

   a.	Severe anxiety-related symptoms are present most of the time. 

   b.	Severe mood-related symptoms are present most of the time.

   c.	Significant behavioural symptoms that cause substantial disruption and distress and are often uncontrollable.

   d.	Currently experiencing a mental health condition (e.g., the impact of complex trauma obsessive-compulsive disorder) where the symptoms are associated with high levels of distress, present most of the time, or are difficult to control. Symptoms may be ongoing or of more recent or sudden onset. 

   e.	Symptoms suggestive of an early form of a severe mental health condition (e.g., odd thinking/behaviour/speech, abnormal perceptions, short periods of unusually elevated mood, a substantial decrease in the need for sleep) or symptoms suggestive of an eating disorder.

   f.	Has been treated by a specialist community mental health service or admitted to hospital for a mental health condition in the past, for issues related to the current episode or current life stressors.
   


**4 = Very severe**

   a.	Very severe and pervasive anxiety symptoms are present virtually all the time and are poorly controlled. 

   b.	Very severe and pervasive mood-related symptoms are present virtually all the time and are poorly controlled. 

   c.	Extreme behavioural symptoms are present in most activities and are rarely capable of being controlled.

   d.	Currently experiencing a mental health condition (e.g., disordered thinking, extreme mood variation, obsessions, extreme avoidant behaviour, severely disordered eating with associated physical symptoms, extreme interpersonal difficulties) and symptoms are very severe, are present virtually all the time, and are poorly controlled. Symptoms may be ongoing or of more recent or sudden onset.

   e.	Highly unusual and bizarre symptoms/behaviours indicating a severe mental illness (e.g., hallucinations, delusions). Symptoms may be ongoing or of more recent or sudden onset.
