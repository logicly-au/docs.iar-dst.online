Domain 6 - Social and Environmental Stressors (Contextual Domain)
==================================================================


Overview
---------

This domain considers the extent and severity of a range of factors in the child's environment that might contribute to the onset or continuation of the mental health issue. 

Significant environmental stressors and adversity can lead to increased symptom severity or compromise the capacity of the child and their family to participate in or benefit from the recommended services. Furthermore, understanding the complexities the child is experiencing (or has experienced) may alter the type of service offered or indicate that additional service referrals are required (e.g., a referral to a social support service).

Assessment on this domain should consider the degree to which any or all the following factors are relevant to the child's current circumstances and the referral decision:

   * Significant transitions (e.g., disruption to educational activities, parental separation/divorce, death of loved one, transitions relating to gender or sexual identity).
   * Peer group stress (e.g., bullying, conflict with or isolation from peer group, loss of friendships).
   * Trauma (e.g., emotional, physical, psychological, or sexual abuse, exploitation, witnessing or being a victim of violence, family and domestic violence, intimate partner violence, natural disaster, exposure to suicide in family/community/school or peer group, loss, conflict).
   * Victimisation (e.g., human rights abuses, discrimination, racial abuse, financial abuse, victim of crime).
   * Family or household stress (e.g., household drug or alcohol abuse, parent or family member with an illness or disability). 
   * Performance-related pressure (e.g., unrealistic role expectations or responsibilities, schooling demands, caregiving responsibilities) and stressors related to high-performance demands in school, dance, sport, and other relevant extra-curricular activities. 
   * Socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty, parental unemployment, unstable or insecure housing).
   * Legal issues (e.g., the juvenile justice system or family court involvement, enforced separation from family).

Evidence points to the contribution made by historical childhood adverse events to longer-term mental health development. Assessment on this domain should consider the child's history but **only** record higher ratings where earlier experiences impact the current situation and require additional specific resources or services.

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Childhood experiences of trauma
     
   Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are stressful events or circumstances that people may experience throughout their childhood. They may relate to childhood physical, sexual, or emotional abuse, physical or emotional neglect, exposure to family violence, parental substance use, parental mental illness, parental separation or divorce, or parental incarceration. 
   
   A summary of the evidence and impacts by Emerging Minds reiterates that: 
   
   *“Exposure to ACEs does not mean poor outcomes are inevitable. If present and reinforced in a child's life, there are known protective factors that can build the child's resilience and reduce the impacts of adversity. Nurturing relationships form the basis of healthy brain development, effective early learning, and a child's capacity to positively respond and adapt to life challenges. Many adults who experienced significant adversity in their childhood have had successful lives and happy relationships* – (Marie-Mitchell & Kostolansky, 2019; Traub & Boynton-Jarrett, 2017).
   
   How a person responds to trauma is highly variable, and many individuals who have been exposed to ACEs will not require a mental health service. Immediate assignment of a level of care based on the experience of trauma alone is problematic and should be avoided. The ACEs study demonstrated a strong relationship between a person's exposure to ACEs and their physical and mental health throughout their lives. Researchers have established a dose-response association for ACEs – for instance, four or more ACEs are associated with an increased risk of adverse impacts. https://emergingminds.com.au/resources/a-general-practitioners-guide-to-common-reactions-to-trauma-and-loss-by-children-aged-6-8-years/ https://emergingminds.com.au/resources/a-general-practitioners-guide-to-common-reactions-to-trauma-and-loss-by-children-aged-9-12-years/



.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Bullying (online and in-person)
     
   Bullying can impact the mental health of children. Children who experience bullying can experience feelings like shame, fear, embarrassment, anger, and worry. There is a marked increase in the risk of poor mental health outcomes, self-harm and suicidal ideation and behaviours among people who experience bullying, particularly if the experience of bullying is severe or prolonged. 
   
   Bullying, whilst common, is not a normal part of growing up, and an initial assessment with a child should explore the child's experience of bullying and the impacts of these experiences. 
   
   Bullying should be considered in the context of social and environmental stressors (Domain 6). The impacts of bullying on the child (if present) will be captured in symptoms severity and distress (Domain 1), risk of harm (Domain 2), and functioning (Domain 3).
   
   When considering the level of care, consideration should be given to the informal supports that a child might require outside the formal mental health system- social, school, family and community supports are generally important for children experiencing bullying.


Scoring
---------

**0 = No problem in this domain – no descriptors apply**


**1 = Mildly stressful environment**

   a. The child is experiencing (or has experienced) one or more stressors that have or are likely to have only a minor impact on the child's mental health. 
	

**2 = Moderately stressful environment**

   a. The child is experiencing (or has experienced) one or more stressors that have, or are likely to have, a moderate impact on the child's mental health.


**3 = Highly stressful environment**

   a. The child is experiencing (or has experienced) one or more stressors that have or are likely to have a significant impact on the child's mental health.


**4 = Extremely stressful environment**

   a. The child is experiencing (or has experienced) one or more stressors that are extreme, enduring or recurring and are having, or are likely to have, a severe impact on the child's mental health.
