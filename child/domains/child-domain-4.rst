Domain 4 - Impact of Co-Existing Conditions (Primary Domain)
=============================================================


Overview
---------

Increasingly, individuals are experiencing and managing multi-morbidity (coexistence of multiple conditions, including chronic disease). 

This domain considers the extent to which other conditions contribute to (or have the potential to contribute to) increased severity of the mental health issue or compromise the child’s ability to participate in the recommended services and support. 

Assessment of a child on this domain should consider the presence, and impact of, three possible coexisting conditions:

   * Physical health conditions.
   * Cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or learning and communication disorder.
   * Substance use/misuse.

Where the child has more than one of the coexisting conditions, consider the condition which has the most impact.

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT - Definitions of intellectual disability, cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and learning and communication disorders
     
   The terms intellectual disability, cognitive impairment, and developmental delay have no universally agreed definitions. For the IAR Guidance, the below definitions will apply: 
   
   Cognitive impairment – A description of a person's current functioning regarding learning, communication, attention, memory, thinking and problem-solving. Cognitive impairment can be temporary or permanent, mild, moderate, or severe. Cognitive impairment can affect what the person can understand and how they relate to others and interpret the environment. 
   
   Intellectual disability – A disability characterised by significant intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour limitations, covering many everyday social and practical skills. This disability originates before the age of 18. Genetic factors cause most intellectual disabilities. However, there are other causes of intellectual disabilities, such as brain injury or being born prematurely. 
   
   Developmental delay – A developmental delay is when a child’s physical, social, emotional, language or communication skill development is not at the level expected for their age and significantly affects their ability to engage in daily routines and activities. 
   
   Learning and communication disorders – learning and communication disorders may affect how a child comprehends, recalls, understands or expresses information. These disorders are often dynamic and can improve over time. The impairment caused by these disorders might be minimal or significant and vary from person to person.


Scoring
---------

**0 = No problem in this domain – no descriptors apply**

**1 = Minor impact**

   a.	Physical health condition(s) present but are stable and have no or minimal impact on the child's mental health.

   b.	Cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or learning and communication disorder present but has no or minimal impact on the child’s mental health and capacity to participate in services.

   c.	Past experimentation or experience with substances, but no recent episodes and no impact on the child's mental health.
   
	

**2 = Moderate impact**

   a.	Physical health condition(s) present and significantly impacts the child's mental health or their ability to participate in services.

   b.	Mild cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or learning and communication disorder with the potential to impact the mental health of the child or their ability to participate in services. 

   c.	Occasional substance use impacts on, or with the potential to impact on, the mental health of the child. 
   


**3 = Severe impact**

   a.	Physical health condition(s) present, require intensive medical monitoring, and seriously affects the child's mental health (e.g., worsened symptoms, heightened distress).

   b.	Cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or learning and communication disorder significantly impacts the child’s mental health and impedes the child’s ability to participate in services.

   c.	Frequent substance use poses a threat to health or represents a barrier to mental health-related recovery.

   d.	Occasional use of extreme risk substances. 
   

**4 = Very severe impact**

   a.	One or more significant physical health conditions exist which are poorly managed or life-threatening, and in the context of a concurrent mental health condition.

   b.	Severe cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, developmental delay, or learning and communication disorder significantly impact the child’s mental health and impedes their ability to participate in services.

   c.	Regular and uncontrolled substance use poses a severe threat to health.

   d.	Frequent use of extreme risk substances.
