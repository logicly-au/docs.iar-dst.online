Domain 7 - Family and Other Supports (Contextual Domain)
=========================================================

Overview
----------

This domain considers whether personal supports, including emotionally nurturing relationships, practical support, and social support are present in the child's environment and their potential to contribute to improved mental health. This domain does not include or consider professional support. Personal supports include:

   * Family/primary caregivers.
   * Friends and peers.
   * Supports within the school environment.
   * Supports within the community (e.g., cultural connections, elders, spiritual leaders, sporting groups, neighbours etc.).
   
A lack of support might contribute to the onset or continuation of the mental health issue.
