Domain 1 - Symptom Severity and Distress (Primary Domain)
===========================================================


Overview
----------

An initial assessment should examine severity of symptoms, distress and previous history of mental
illness. Severity of current symptoms and associated levels of distress are important factors in
assigning a level of care and making a referral decision. Assessing changes in symptom severity and
distress also forms an important part of outcome monitoring.

Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:

   * current symptoms and duration
   * level of distress
   * experience of mental illness
   * are symptoms improving/worsening, is distress improving/worsening, are new symptoms emerging?

Validated measures such as the K10, K5 (for Aboriginal People), PHQ-9 and GAD-7 are potentially useful for understanding symptom severity and distress. Threshold points for each of these instruments to guide judgements about problem severity are provided below.

.. admonition:: PRACTICE POINT

   The standard assessment tools described in this Guidance are a potentially useful way of 
   gathering information about current clinical need and may provide a useful baseline from 
   which to measure the benefit of any intervention. However, the findings from standard
   assessment tools are, on their own, not enough to inform assessment and referral decisions. 
   Furthermore, assessment tools should only be used if clinically appropriate, and with 
   consent from the consumer. The scores and ranges from standard assessment tools are not
   indicative of a diagnosis, but representative of distress, functional impairment or 
   likelihood of a diagnosis at the time the measure was scored and is not a diagnostic 
   assessment.
   **Where there is significant discordance between clinician assessment and scores on standard
   assessment measures- this is an indicator that a comprehensive assessment is required.**

Scoring
--------

**0 = No problem in this domain â€“ no descriptors apply**

**1 = Mild or sub diagnostic**

   a) Currently experiencing some, but not all, of the symptoms associated with an anxiety
      disorder (e.g., symptoms like excessive worry, difficulty concentrating) or depressive
      disorder (e.g., symptoms like sadness, irritability, exhaustion, disrupted sleep, anger) that
      have typically been present for less than 6 months (but this may vary). Current symptoms at
      a level that would likely result in a diagnosis or causing mild level of distress.

   b) Currently experiencing mild distress.

   c) Currently experiencing symptoms (described above) at sub-diagnostic level but risk of
      escalating.

*Indicative score for sub diagnostic or mild symptoms on commonly used assessment tools:*

======  ========================  ===============================
\       Sub-diagnostic symptoms   Mild diagnostic-level symptoms
======  ========================  ===============================
PHQ-9   0-4                       5-9
GAD-7   0-5                       5-9
K10     10-19                     20-24 
K5      5-9                       10-12
======  ========================  ===============================

**2 = Moderate**

   a) Currently experiencing symptoms indicative of an anxiety disorder (e.g., excessive worry,
      panic, racing mind, difficulty concentrating) or depressive disorder (e.g., excessive sadness,
      irritability, exhaustion, disrupted sleep, loss of interest and pleasure) that have typically
      been present for more than 6 months (but this may vary) but symptoms may be of more
      recent origin. Symptoms are at a level that would likely meet diagnostic criteria, and/or are
      causing moderate to high levels of distress.

   b) Currently experiencing moderate to high levels of distress.

   c) History of a diagnosed mental health condition that has not responded to treatment, with
      continuing symptoms and moderate to high levels of distress.

*Indicative score for Moderate symptoms on commonly used assessment tools:*

:PHQ-9: 10-14
:GAD-7:	10-14
:K10:	25-29
:K5: 12-14


**3 = Severe**

   a) A history of significant and ongoing symptoms indicative of a severe mental illness (e.g.,
      hallucinations, paranoia, disordered thinking, extreme mood variation, delusions, extreme
      avoidant behaviour) but the symptoms are mostly well managed or are re-appearing and at
      risk of escalation without ongoing assistance.

   b) Other mental health condition that is causing high to very high levels of distress.

   c) Recent onset of symptoms indicative of a severe mental illness and/or the person is
      experiencing high to very high levels of distress.

   d) Has been admitted to hospital for a mental health condition in previous 12 months.

*Indicative score for Severe symptoms on commonly used assessment tools:*

:PHQ-9: 15-19
:GAD-7:	15+
:K10:	30-50
:K5: 15-25
 

**4 = Very severe**

   a) A history of significant and persistent symptoms that are indicative of a severe mental illness
      (e.g., hallucinations, paranoia, disordered thinking, extreme mood variation, delusions,
      severe avoidant behaviour) and symptoms are mostly poorly managed.

   b) Recent onset of symptoms that are indicative of a severe mental illness (e.g., hallucinations,
      paranoia, disordered thinking, extreme mood variation, delusions, severe avoidant
      behaviours) presenting in the context of significant complexity requiring multiple agency
      involvement

   c) Other long-term mental health condition presenting in the context of significant complexity
      that requires multiple agency involvement.

*Indicative score for very severe symptoms on commonly used assessment tools:*

:PHQ-9: 20-27
:GAD-7:	15+
:K10:	30-50
:K5: 15-25
