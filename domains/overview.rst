Overview
--------

The initial assessment process recommended in this Guidance identifies eight domains that should be assessed when determining the next steps in the referral and treatment process for a person referred to a PHN commissioned mental health service. The eight domains fall into two categories:

   * *Primary Assessment Domains (Domains 1 to 4)*: These cover Symptoms Severity and Distress, Risk of Harm, Functioning and Impact of Co-existing Conditions. Primary Assessment Domains represent the basic areas for initial assessment that have direct implications for decisions about assignment to a level of care.

   * *Contextual Domains (Domains 5-8)*: These cover Treatment and Recovery History, Social and Environmental Stressors, Family and Other Supports and Engagement and Motivation. Assessment on these domains provides essential context to moderate decisions indicated by the primary domains.

Initial assessment for individuals presenting for assistance should consider the consumer's current situation on all eight domains. Each domain looks at specific factors relevant to making decisions about a level of care that is most likely going to be suitable for the person's care needs. The selection of the domains, and factors covered in each domain, aims to capture a limited number of key areas that a clinician would consider when determining the most appropriate services for an individual referred for care.

   If there is uncertainty in the ratings during the initial assessment, the individual should be supported to access an appropriate 	 clinician for a comprehensive assessment.
   
   Clinicians using the Decision Support Tool should never "rate up" when uncertain. The clinician should build
   certainty to rate with confidence (e.g., through additional questions or administering a standard assessment
   tool), seeking additional clinical input, or referring for a comprehensive assessment.
   
   "Rating up" may erroneously signal an issue that is not present for the individual and result in an inaccurate
   representation of that person's treatment needs.


Underpinning the concept of domains is the concept of relative importance and severity â€“ some factors within each domain are more important than others, and some domains are more critical in the overall assessment of an individual's need for a given level of care. While the relative importance of each domain may vary for each consumer, an overall judgement is needed that requires decisions to be made about the
severity of presenting problems within each domain.

An individual's presenting problems on each domain can interact in different ways. For example, a person presenting with mild to moderate symptoms but no significant problems on any of the contextual domains may require a different level of care from one with mild to moderate symptoms but extensive social and environmental stressors or a poor response to previous treatment.

Scoring
^^^^^^^

Domains are rated using a scoring system that grades each domain on a 5-point scale, where:

|   0 = No problem
|
|   1 = Mild problem
|
|   2 = Moderate problem
|
|   3 = Severe problem
|
|   4 = Very severe problem
