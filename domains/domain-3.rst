Domain 3 - Functioning (Primary Domain)
========================================


Overview
---------

An initial assessment should consider functional impairment caused by or
exacerbated by the mental health condition. While other types of disabilities
may play a role in determining what types of support services may be required,
they should generally not be considered in determining mental health
intervention intensity within a stepped care continuum.

Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:

   * a person’s ability to fulfil usual roles/ responsibilities
   * impact on or disruption to areas of life (e.g., employment, parenting, education, or other social roles)
   * impact on the person’s basic activities of daily living (e.g., self-care, mobility, toileting, feeding, and personal hygiene).


Scoring
---------

**0 = No problems in this domain – no descriptors apply**

**1 = Mild impact**

   a. Diminished ability to function in one or more of their usual roles,
      including work, social, parenting/care of dependents, education but without
      significant or adverse consequences.

   b. The person experiences brief and transient disruptions in functioning

**2 = Moderate impact**

   a. Functioning is impaired in more than one of their usual roles including
      work, social, parenting and family, education, to the extent that they are
      unable to meet the requirements of those roles on average 1 to 2 days per
      month.

   b. The person experiences occasional difficulties with basic activities of
      daily living but without threat to health.

**3 = Severe impact**

   a. Significant difficulties with functioning, resulting in disruption to many
      areas of the person's life (e.g., work, education, interpersonal
      relationships, self-care) but the person can function independently with
      adequate treatment and community support.

   b. The person experiences difficulties with basic self-care (hygiene, eating,
      appearance) on a frequent, consistent basis but without threat to health.

**4 = Very severe to extreme impact**

   a. Profound difficulties with functioning, resulting in major disruption to
      virtually all areas of the person’s life (e.g., unable to work or participate
      in education, withdrawal from interpersonal relationships).

   b. Mental health condition contributes to severe and persistent self-neglect
      that poses a threat to health.
