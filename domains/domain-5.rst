Domain 5 - Treatment and Recovery History (Contextual Domain)
==============================================================



Overview
---------

This initial assessment domain should explore the individualâ€™s relevant treatment history and their
response to previous treatment. Response to previous treatment is a reasonable predictor of future
treatment need and is particularly important when determining appropriateness of lower intensity
services.

Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:

   * whether there has been previous treatment (including specialist or mental health inpatient
     treatment)
   * if the person is currently engaged in treatment
   * their response to past or current treatment

When considering this domain relevant treatment refers to treatment by a qualified mental health provider rather than informal care provided by friends, family or social networks.
