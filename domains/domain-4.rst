Domain 4 - Impact of Co-existing Conditions (Primary Domain)
=============================================================


Overview
---------

Increasingly, individuals are experiencing and managing multi-morbidity (coexistence of multiple
conditions including chronic disease). An initial assessment should specifically examine the presence
of other concurrent health conditions that contribute to (or have the potential to contribute to)
increased severity of mental health problems and/or compromises the person’s ability to participate
in the recommended treatment.

Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:

   * substance use/misuse and the associated impact on the individual
   * physical health condition and the associated impact on the individual's concurrent mental health condition
   * intellectual disability or cognitive impairment
