Level 2 - Low Intensity Services
=================================


Definition
-----------

Low intensity services are designed to be accessed quickly (without the need for a formal referral e.g., through a third-party service or provider), easily (through a range of modalities including face to face, group work, telephone and digital interventions) and typically involve few or short sessions.

Care environment
------------------

Services are easily accessible and available online, over the telephone or in the community. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., within schools, workplaces and general practice).

Core clinical services
------------------------

   * Psychoeducation and information via a GP. The GP may also consider developing a MHTP (if consistent with Medicare Benefits Schedule).

   * Evidence-based low intensity interventions (including online, telephone and face to face low intensity structured psychological services, or brief interventions delivered by mental health professionals).


Other clinical interventions that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * lifestyle interventions (e.g., nutrition, sleep, exercise, meaningful social connections), and

   * group work.


Support services
------------------

Additional services, if needed, are focussed on actively linking the person with services that can help to practically address any situational stressors (e.g., finances).

Referral criteria
------------------

A person suitable for this level of care typically has minimal or no risk factors, is usually experiencing mild symptoms/low levels of distress, and where present, this is likely to be in response to a stressful environment. Symptoms have typically been present for a short period of time (less than 6 months but this may vary). The individual is generally functioning well but may have problems with motivation or engagement that contraindicate a referral to Level 1 care. Where the person has experienced previous treatment for a previous episode, they are likely to have had a moderate or better recovery.

Complexity indicated by significant problems in Risk, Functioning or Co-existing Conditions should be considered as contraindications for referral to Level 2 care and trigger a referral to Level 3 or higher.

Using the Initial Assessment Rating Glossary to support decision making
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals suited to this level of care may have been rated during the initial assessment as having:

   * Mild or no problems on all Primary Domains (Symptom Severity and Distress, Risk of Harm, Functioning and Co-existing Conditions, all scores ≤ 1) **AND**
   
      * moderate problems on Treatment and Recovery History (score ≤ 2) and limited Engagement and Motivation (score ≥ 2) 

      **OR**

      * high Social and Environmental Stressors (score ≤ 3) and limited Engagement and Motivation (score ≥ 2)

      **OR**
			
      * Mild Symptoms and Distress (score = 1) in the context of moderate Co-existing Conditions (score =2)

      **OR**
			
      * Moderate Symptoms and Distress (score = 2) but no significant problems indicated by Risk of Harm, Functioning or Co-existing Conditions (all scores ≤ 1).
