Level 4 - High Intensity Services
===================================

Definition
-----------

High intensity services including periods of intensive intervention that may involve multi-disciplinary support. Usually supporting people experiencing severe mental illness, significant functional impairment and/or risk factors.

Care environment
-----------------

Typically, face to face interventions in community locations (e.g., consulting rooms) or outreach to the person within their home or other environment.

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive psychological assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all individuals suited to this level of care.

   * evidence based psychological interventions provided by a mental health clinician

   * clinical care coordination services within primary care (if more than 2 services are involved in providing care)

   * involvement of a mental health nurse

   * community-based psychiatric care

   * active GP management, mental health assessment, integrated physical health care (and development of a MHTP)

Support services
-----------------

Additional services are likely to be needed and may include:

   * psycho-social disability support services (including peer support, daily living support, social skills training and social participation support)

   * community supports (including peer support and social participation support)

   * support to access support and advice relating to known environmental stressors

   * lifestyle interventions (e.g., nutrition, sleep, exercise, meaningful social connections)

Referral criteria
-------------------

A person requiring this level of care usually has a diagnosed mental health condition with significant symptoms and/or significant problems with functioning. A person with a severe presentation is likely to be experiencing moderate or higher problems associated with Risk, Functioning and Co-existing Conditions. Where problems are assessed as very severe in symptom, risk or functioning domains, a referral to Level 5 care should be considered.

Using the Initial Assessment Rating Glossary to support decision making
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals suited to this level of care may have been rated:

   * Severe Symptoms and Distress (score = 3) with significant associated problems on one or more other Primary Domains â€œ(Risk of Harm, Functioning, scores 2 or 3, or Co-existing Conditions score of 4)

   **OR**

   * Severe Symptoms and Distress in the context of very severe problems (score = 4) on either Risk of Harm or Functioning are not suited to this level but should be referred for Level 5 care.
