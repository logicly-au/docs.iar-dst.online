Level 1 - Self Management
===========================

Definition
------------

Services at this level of care are designed to prevent the onset of illness and are mostly focussed on supporting the person to self-manage any distress or symptoms. This level of care generally involves evidence-based digital therapies and other forms of self-help. A summary of the evidence based digital mental health therapies and self-help services is available through the `Head to Health <https://headtohealth.gov.au/>`_ website.

Care environment
------------------

Services are easily accessible and available online, via telephone or in the community. Services may also be available in integrated settings (e.g., within schools, workplaces and general practice).

Core clinical services
-----------------------

This level of care is focussed on self-help activities. Clinical services are generally not required, however where they are involved they should:

   * Be focussed on monitoring, with capability to step up in to other interventions as required.

   * Include psychoeducation and information via a GP. The GP may also consider developing a MHTP (if consistent with Medicare Benefits Schedule).


Other clinical interventions that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * lifestyle interventions (e.g., nutrition, sleep, exercise, meaningful social connections), and

   * group work.


Support services
------------------

Additional services, if needed, are focussed on actively linking the person with services that can help to practically address any situational stressors (e.g., finances).

Referral criteria
-------------------

A person suitable for this level of care typically has no risk of harm, is usually experiencing mild symptoms and/or no distress/low levels of distress- which may be in response to recent psycho-social stressors. Symptoms have typically been present for a short period of time. The individual is generally functioning well and should be motivated to pursue self-management options. People experiencing a lack of motivation/engagement should not be referred to this level of care because these problems will work against involvement in self-management strategies. Additionally, Level 1 care is unlikely to be suitable for those with severe problems in their treatment/recovery history or
very severe environmental stressors – each of these would usually trigger a referral to Level 3 care.

Using the Initial Assessment Rating Glossary to support decision making
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals suited to this level of care may have been rated during the initial assessment as having:

   * Mild or no problems on all Primary Domains (Symptoms, Risk, Functioning and Co-existing Conditions, all scores ≤ 1) **AND**
   
      * No significant problems on Treatment and Recovery History, Social and Environmental Stressors and Engagement and Motivation (all scores ≤ 1)

      **OR**

      * Moderate problems on Treatment and Recovery History (score ≤ 2) but with good Engagement and Motivation (score ≤ 1) 

      **OR**

      * High Social and Environmental Stressors (score ≤ 3) but with good Engagement and Motivation (score ≤ 1).
