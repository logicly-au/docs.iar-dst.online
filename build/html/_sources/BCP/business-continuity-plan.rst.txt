Business Continuity Plan
========================

Identified Risk: Facility loss - Datacom Hosting Facility
----------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Data client facing services (applications) are hosted at the Datacom shared hosting facility.

Short term: one week or less
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the event is assessed to be resolved in one (1) week or less Strategic Data will:

* inform all clients affected by the event,

* maintain active communication on the status of the event with all clients affected by the event,

* re-assess the event daily in order to identify if the severity / duration is greater than expected.

Recovery will not be attempted until it has been determined that the event will last more than one week.

Long term: More than one week
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Strategic Data will notify all clients and stakeholders of the event and initiate disaster recovery processes as appropriate; including, :doc:`retrieval of backups from IronMountain <tech/system-backup-recovery>` and service re-establishment as required.

Identified Risk: Facility loss - Fitzroy Office
------------------------------------------------

Strategic Data's development and client support infrastructure is largely hosted in the server room at the Fitzroy office.

Short term
^^^^^^^^^^^

Management will assess to what extent it makes sense for staff to work from an alternate location - including from home.

Long term
^^^^^^^^^^

As per the process for a long term event at the hosting facility.

Loss of Key Personnel and Managing Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Search RT for all projects owned by the person who is unavailable

2. Reassign Project tickets to the 2IC and assign a new 2IC.

3. Ensure that the person now responsible for the project is aware of their new responsibility and keep them informed about any changes to the circumstances.

4. If a person is the 2IC for a large number of projects, Management may redistribute some of the projects - especially if the Personnel loss is going to be for a long period of time.

Telephones, Email and Ticketing system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Telstra can redirect the office numbers to mobile phones (only if connectivity is the issue - request to IT Strategic). There is no ability to move email or ticketing.

Client Contact Information
---------------------------

A director can provide the email with the links to active client information in the intranet. This information provides the relevant contact details for each client / project and is generated daily via an automated process.
