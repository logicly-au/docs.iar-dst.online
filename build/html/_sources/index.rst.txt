Initial Assessment and Referral Decision Support Tool
=======================================================

**Version 1.02 - draft**

**30 August 2019**


This Guidance is focussed on the initial response to requests for mental health assistance in
primary care settings, and is designed to assist the various parties involved in the referral and
assessment process. 
	
This Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent evidence-informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be   refined as new evidence emerges.
	
It is expected that PHNs will use the Guidance to:

   * Design initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned primary mental health care services.
   * Review existing initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned primary mental health care services.
   * Guide the development of referral pathways (e.g., Health Pathways).
   * Provide clear and consistent information to referrers, consumers, carers and communities.
   * Instigate clinical governance policies and protocols to monitor the safety and quality of assessment and referral systems.

Whilst this Guidance refers to the critical interface between primary mental health care and acute,
tertiary and specialist secondary settings, this Guidance is not intended to be applied within acute or
specialist mental health care settings. The Guidance has the potential to be used in private
psychology and psychiatry services.
