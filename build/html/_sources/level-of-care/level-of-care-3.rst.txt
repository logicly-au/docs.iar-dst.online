Level 3 - Moderate Intensity Services
=======================================


Definition
-----------

Moderate intensity services generally provide structured, reasonably frequent and intensive interventions (e.g., a defined number of psychological sessions delivered regularly).

Care environment
------------------

Typically, community locations (e.g., consulting rooms), outreach in to residential environments (e.g., aged care facilities, schools) or if appropriate, via telephone or video-conference (e.g., for people in remote communities), and clinician assisted e-therapies.

Core clinical services
------------------------

A comprehensive psychological assessment (if not already undertaken) is required for all individuals suited to this level of care.

   * Evidence based psychological interventions provided by a mental health clinician.

   * Active GP management, mental health assessment (and development of a MHTP).


Other clinical interventions that may be required
---------------------------------------------------

   * community based psychiatry

   * clinical care coordination services within primary care (if more than 2 services are involved in providing care)


Support services
------------------

Additional services, if needed, are focussed on:

   * community supports (including peer support and social participation support)

   * support to access support and advice relating to known environmental stressors

   * lifestyle interventions (e.g., nutrition, sleep, exercise, meaningful social connections)

Referral criteria
-------------------

A person requiring this level of care is likely to be experiencing mild to moderate symptoms/distress (that would meet criteria for a diagnosis). Symptoms have typically been present for 6 months or more (but this may vary). Initial assessment would usually indicate complexity on risk, functioning or multimorbidity but not at very severe levels, which should trigger consideration of a referral to Level
5. People experiencing severe symptoms with mild or no problems associated with Risk, Functioning and Co-existing Conditions are usually suitable for this level of care.

Using the Initial Assessment Rating Glossary to support decision making
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Individuals suited to this level of care may have been rated during the initial assessment as having:

   * Mild or lesser problems on all Primary Domains (Symptoms and Distress, Risk of Harm, Functioning, Co-existing Conditions, all scores ≤ 1) but with indications of significant problems in relation to Treatment and Recovery History (score ≥ 3) or high Social and Environmental Stressors (scores ≥ 4)

   **OR**
 
   * Mild or lesser Symptoms and Distress (score ≤ 1) but with complexity indicated by significant problems on Risk of Harm or Functioning (scores ≥ 2) or Co-existing Conditions (score ≥ 2)

   **OR**

   * Moderate Symptoms and Distress (score = 2) with associated moderate or higher problems on any other Primary Domain (Risk of Harm, Functioning, Co-existing Conditions, scores ≥ 2) 

   **OR**

   * Severe Symptoms and Distress (score = 3) but problems on all other Primary Domain (Risk of Harm, Functioning, Co-existing Conditions) are mild or less (all scores ≤ 1).


*Individuals with a rating of 3 or higher on Symptoms may be accommodated at this level, only	where ALL other primary assessment domains are rated as 1 or less*
