Domain 6 - Social and Environmental Stressors (Contextual Domain)
==================================================================


Overview
---------

This initial assessment domain should consider how the person’s environment might contribute to the onset or maintenance of a mental health condition. Significant situational or social complexities can lead to increased condition severity and/or compromise ability to participate in the recommended treatment. Unresolved situational or social complexities can limit the likely benefit of treatment. Furthermore, understanding the complexities experienced by the individual (with carer/support person perspectives if available), may alter the type of service offered, or indicate that additional service referrals may be required (e.g., a referral to an emergency housing provider).

Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider life circumstances that may be associated with distress such as:

   * significant transitions (e.g., job loss, relationship breakdown, sudden or unexpected death of loved one)
   * trauma (e.g., physical, psychological or sexual abuse, witnessing or being a victim of an extremely violent incident, natural disaster)
   * experiencing harm from others (including violence, vulnerability, exploitation)
   * interpersonal or social difficulties (e.g., conflict with friend or colleague, loneliness, social isolation, bullying, relationship   difficulties)
   * performance related pressure (e.g., work, school, exam stress)
   * ability to or difficulty having basic physical, emotional, environmental or material needs met (such as homelessness, unsafe living environment, poverty)
   * illness
   * legal issues
