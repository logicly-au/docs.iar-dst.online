<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This Guidance is focussed on the initial response to requests for mental health assistance in
primary care settings, and is designed to assist the various parties involved in the referral and
assessment process.</p>
<p>This Guidance has been developed to support nationally consistent evidence-informed initial assessment and referral processes and will be refined as new evidence emerges.</p>
<p>It is expected that PHNs will use the Guidance to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Design initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned primary mental health care services.</li>
<li>Review existing initial assessment and referral processes for commissioned primary mental health care services.</li>
<li>Guide the development of referral pathways (e.g., Health Pathways).</li>
<li>Provide clear and consistent information to referrers, consumers, carers and communities.</li>
<li>Instigate clinical governance policies and protocols to monitor the safety and quality of assessment and referral systems.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Whilst this Guidance refers to the critical interface between primary mental health care and acute,
tertiary and specialist secondary settings, this Guidance is not intended to be applied within acute or
specialist mental health care settings. The Guidance has the potential to be used in private
psychology and psychiatry services.</p>

<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The initial assessment process recommended in this Guidance identifies eight domains that should be assessed when determining the next steps in the referral and treatment process for a person referred to a PHN commissioned mental health service. The eight domains fall into two categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><em>Primary Assessment Domains</em> (Domains 1 to 4): These cover Symptoms and Distress, Risk of Harm, Functioning and Impact of Co-existing Conditions. Primary Assessment Domains represent the basic areas for initial assessment that have direct implications for decisions about assignment to a level of care.</li>
<li><em>Contextual Domains</em> (Domains 5-8): These cover Treatment and Recovery History, Social and Environmental Stressors, Family and Other Supports and Engagement/Motivation. Assessment on these domains provides essential context to moderate decisions indicated by the primary domains.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Initial assessment for individuals presenting for assistance should consider the consumer’s current situation on all eight domains. Each domain looks at specific factors relevant to making decisions about a level of care that is most likely going to be suitable for the person’s care needs. The selection of the domains, and factors covered in each domain, aims to capture a limited number of key areas that a clinician would consider when determining the most appropriate services for an individual referred for care.</p>
<div class="style-admonition admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT</p>
<p class="last">If there is uncertainty in the ratings during the initial assessment, the individual should be supported to access an appropriate     clinician for a comprehensive assessment</p>
</div>
<p>Underpinning the concept of domains is the concept of relative importance and severity – some factors within each domain are more important than others, and some domains are more critical in the overall assessment of an individual’s need for a given level of care. While the relative importance of each domain may vary for each consumer, an overall judgement is needed that requires decisions to be made about the severity of presenting problems within each domain.</p>
<p>An individual’s presenting problems on each domain can interact in different ways. For example, a person presenting with mild to moderate symptoms but no significant problems on any of the contextual domains may require a different level of care from one with mild to moderate symptoms but extensive social and environmental stressors or a poor response to previous treatment.</p>
<div class="section" id="scoring">
<h4>Scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Domains can be rated, using a scoring system that grades each domain on a 5-point scale of severity, where:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">0 = No problem</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">1 = Mild problem</div>

<h3>Domain 1 - Symptom Severity and Distress (Primary Domain)<a class="headerlink" href="#domain-1-symptom-severity-and-distress-primary-domain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h4>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An initial assessment should examine severity of symptoms, distress and previous history of mental
illness. Severity of current symptoms and associated levels of distress are important factors in
assigning a level of care and making a referral decision. Assessing changes in symptom severity and
distress also forms an important part of outcome monitoring.</p>
<p>Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>current symptoms and duration</li>
<li>level of distress</li>
<li>experience of mental illness</li>
<li>are symptoms improving/worsening, is distress improving/worsening, are new symptoms emerging?</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Validated measures such as the K10, K5 (for Aboriginal People), PHQ-9, GAD-7 and the EPDS are potentially useful for understanding symptom severity and distress.</p>
<div class="admonition-practice-point admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT</p>
<p class="last">The standard assessment tools described in this Guidance are a potentially useful way of
gathering information about current clinical need and may provide a useful baseline from
which to measure the benefit of any intervention. However, the findings from standard
assessment tools are, on their own, not enough to inform assessment and referral decisions.
Furthermore, assessment tools should only be used if clinically appropriate, and with
consent from the consumer. The scores and ranges from standard assessment tools are not
indicative of a diagnosis, but representative of distress, functional impairment or
likelihood of a diagnosis at the time the measure was scored and is not a diagnostic
assessment.
<strong>Where there is significant discordance between clinician assessment and scores on standard
assessment measures - this is an indicator that a comprehensive assessment is required.</strong></p>

<h4>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>An initial assessment should include an evaluation of risk to determine a person’s potential for harm
to self or others. Results from this assessment are of fundamental importance in deciding the
appropriate level of care required.</p>
<p>Recent Australian and international evidence indicates that risk prediction is a flawed, imprecise and
misleading activity in mental healthcare (link to evidence) that contributes to both over and under
prediction of risk. This domain is not about predicting the individuals that are likely to attempt or
complete suicide or other forms of harm, rather this domain guides evaluation of risk to inform the
most appropriate response and/or referral. This domain is focussed on examining:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>suicidality – current and past suicidal ideation, attempts</li>
<li>self-harm (non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour) – current and past</li>
<li>deterioration of mental state that poses danger to self or others</li>
<li>self-neglect that poses a risk to the person’s safety</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The PHQ-9 (item 9) and the EPDS (item 10) include specific items relating to suicide or self-harm risk. If these tools are used, endorsement on these risk-related items should be reviewed to assist with rating on this domain.</p>
<div class="admonition-practice-point admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT</p>
<p class="last">Risk of harm must be considered in the context of information gathered on the other 7 domains - information gathered across the other 7 domains (e.g., if the person is experiencing loneliness, or significant environmental stressors) is very important in evaluating harm.</p>

<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section provides a description of the different levels of care. The information gathered through
the initial assessment is used to assign a level of care and inform a referral decision. The
levels of care are not intended to replace individualised assessment and care - rather to provide
information to guide decision making.</p>
<div class="admonition-practice-point-a-note-about-consumer-choice-and-preference admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT - A NOTE ABOUT CONSUMER CHOICE AND PREFERENCE</p>
<p>There is strong evidence to indicate that when a consumer works in partnership with a trusted health care professional and is involved in                       making decisions about their care and selection of the service of ‘best fit’, they are less likely to drop-out of care, and more likely to experience positive outcomes (reference). World class health care considers the choices and preferences of the individual. In a stepped care model, the individual should be given a choice within “steps” or within a level of care (e.g., the consumer may have a strong preference for telephone-based psychological interventions rather than face-to-face). A choice across “steps” or levels of care is not always practical or necessary (e.g., if the consumer does not require higher intensity supports) and this can often be resolved using supported decision-making strategies.</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><p>Supported decision-making strategies for initial assessment and referral:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Make sure the consumer is provided with information using their preferred way of
receiving information (e.g., written/verbal/visual, English/other language, with/without a
support person).</li>
<li>Make sure the consumer is provided with a list of recommended intervention options
(including the option of no intervention) and encourage the consumer to contribute their
own options, ideas, solutions and expectations. This might include interventions such as
culturally relevant activities, or self-care strategies.</li>
<li>Ensure the consumer can express any concerns or fears about the options (e.g., cost, travel,
previous positive or negative experiences).</li>
<li>Be prepared to talk about the pros and cons of each option (e.g., intensity, intervention
length and commitment required, waiting periods, potential impact on symptoms).</li>
<li>Check in to ensure the consumer has understood the information provided and ensure
enough time for any questions from the consumer (or carer/family member).</li>
<li>Support the decision of the consumer, acknowledging that other options can be explored in
the future if this decision does not work out.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>Mental health services in Australia represent a complex array of service types, ranging from
population-level services available to all on the internet through to highly specialised services that
include short and long-term hospital care.</p>
<p>Grouping these into ‘levels’ is aimed at describing a continuum of services based on <strong>levels of
resource intensity</strong>. This is not intended to imply that there is natural division of service types into
tiered categories. While some services are associated with a single level of care, most will appear in
multiple categories. For example, GP mental health care can be associated with lower levels of care
when it is provided in isolation, or higher levels when delivered in combination with other services
or interventions (e.g., psychiatrist or involvement of a multidisciplinary team).</p>
<p>The levels therefore are best thought of as combinations of interventions that form potential
‘packages’ for people requiring that level of care. The levels are differentiated by the amount and
scope of resources available. A given individual may use some or all interventions described at that
level and move between levels of care as required.</p>
<p>The core services and additional supports listed within each level of care include intervention
options generally available within the mental health sector more broadly. The core services and
additional supports do not represent PHN-only commissioned services. In any region, the core
services and additional supports may be available through a variety of funding sources and
providers.</p>

<h4>Primary mental health care falls into Levels 1 to 4<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-mental-health-care-falls-into-levels-1-to-4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Level 1 (self-management) is suggested for those with relatively minor problems on the Primary Domains. Contraindications to Level 1 care include problems with engagement/motivation (because these will work against any referral to self-management strategies) and severe problems in treatment/recovery history or very severe environmental stressors.</li>
<li>Level 2 (low intensity interventions) is targeted at people with mild problems in the primary domains, where these do not present in the context of significant problems on the contextual domains. Level 2 may also be suitable for people with moderate symptoms, but this is dependent on extent of presenting problems on other primary and contextual domains.</li>
<li>Level 3 (moderate intensity interventions) is targeted at people with mild to moderate symptoms/distress where these present in the context of significant problems on other domains. Level 3 is also proposed as suitable for management of severe symptoms where no significant problems are present on other primary domains.</li>
<li>Level 4 (high intensity interventions) is targeted to individuals with severe symptoms/distress, where these occur in the context of significant other problems (up to severe levels). Level 4 is not suitable for people with severe symptoms who present with very severe problems on either risk or functioning.

<h4>Referral criteria to levels of care<a class="headerlink" href="#referral-criteria-to-levels-of-care" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Suggested referral criteria for each of the Levels are outlined in descriptions of levels of care that
follow. These are based on the initial assessment of each of the domains. As the domains are
interactive (in that each of the assessment factors can interact with judgements on other domains)
there is considerable complexity in the possible combinations. The suggested referral criteria aim to
simplify the approach by focusing only on the main patterns of presenting problems likely to be
found in primary mental health care.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the proposed referral criteria are offered only to guide judgements
about the likely best treatment option. Each presenting individual will have unique requirements
that must always take precedence in decision making.</p>

Symptoms have typically been present for a short period of time. The individual is generally functioning well and should be motivated to pursue self-management options. People experiencing a lack of motivation/engagement should not be referred to this level of care because these problems will work against involvement in self-management strategies. Additionally, Level 1 care is unlikely to be suitable for those with severe problems in their treatment/recovery history or
very severe environmental stressors – each of these would usually trigger a referral to Level 3 care.</p>

<p>A person requiring this level of care is likely to be experiencing mild to moderate symptoms/distress (that would meet criteria for a diagnosis). Symptoms have typically been present for 6 months or more (but this may vary). Initial assessment would usually indicate complexity on risk, functioning or multimorbidity but not at very severe levels, which should trigger consideration of a referral to Level
5. People experiencing severe symptoms with mild or no problems associated with Risk, Functioning and Co-existing Conditions are usually suitable for this level of care.</p>
