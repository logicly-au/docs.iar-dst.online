The eight domains fall into two categories:<blockquote><div><ul class="simple"><li><em>Primary Assessment Domains</em> (Domains 1 to 4): These cover Symptoms and Distress, Risk of Harm, Functioning and Impact of Co-existing Conditions. Primary Assessment Domains represent the basic areas for initial assessment that have direct implications for decisions about assignment to a level of care.<li><em>Contextual Domains</em> (Domains 5-8): These cover Treatment and Recovery History, Social and Environmental Stressors, Family and Other Supports and Engagement/Motivation. Assessment on these domains provides essential context to moderate decisions indicated by the primary domains.</ul></div></blockquote><p>Initial assessment for individuals presenting for assistance should consider the consumer&rsquo;s current situation on all eight domains. Each domain looks at specific factors relevant to making decisions about a level of care that is most likely going to be suitable for the person&rsquo;s care needs. The selection of the domains, and factors covered in each domain, aims to capture a limited number of key areas that a clinician would consider when determining the most appropriate services for an individual referred for care.<div class="style-admonition admonition"><p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT<p class="last">If there is uncertainty in the ratings during the initial assessment, the individual should be supported to access an appropriate clinician for a comprehensive assessment</div><p>Underpinning the concept of domains is the concept of relative importance and severity &ndash; some factors within each domain are more important than others, and some domains are more critical in the overall assessment of an individual&rsquo;s need for a given level of care. While the relative importance of each domain may vary for each consumer, an overall judgement is needed that requires decisions to be made about the severity of presenting problems within each domain.<p>An individual&rsquo;s presenting problems on each domain can interact in different ways. For example, a person presenting with mild to moderate symptoms but no significant problems on any of the contextual domains may require a different level of care from one with mild to moderate symptoms but extensive social and environmental stressors or a poor response to previous treatment.<div class="section" id="scoring"><h4>Scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Permalink to this headline">&para;</a></h4><p>Domains can be rated, using a scoring system that grades each domain on a 5-point scale of severity, where:<div class="line-block"><div class="line">0 = No problem</div><div class="line"><br /></div><div class="line">1 = Mild problem</div><div class="line"><br /></div><div class="line">2 = Moderate problem</div><div class="line"><br /></div><div class="line">3 = Severe problem</div><div class="line"><br /></div><div class="line">4 = Very severe problem</div></div></div></div><span id="document-domains/domain-1" style="font-size: 0.01px; line-height: 0.01px; display:inline-block; float:right">&#x200B;</span><div class="section" id="domain-1-symptom-severity-and-distress-primary-domain"><h3>Domain 1 - Symptom Severity and Distress (Primary Domain)</h3><div class="section" id="overview"><h4>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">&para;</a></h4><p>An initial assessment should examine severity of symptoms, distress and previous history of mental illness. Severity of current symptoms and associated levels of distress are important factors in assigning a level of care and making a referral decision. Assessing changes in symptom severity and distress also forms an important part of outcome monitoring.<p>Assessment of an individual on this domain should consider:<blockquote><div><ul class="simple"><li>current symptoms and duration<li>level of distress<li>experience of mental illness<li>are symptoms improving/worsening, is distress improving/worsening, are new symptoms emerging?</ul></div></blockquote><p>Validated measures such as the K10, K5 (for Aboriginal People), PHQ-9, GAD-7 and the EPDS are potentially useful for understanding symptom severity and distress. Threshold points for each of these instruments to guide judgements about problem severity are provided below.<div class="admonition-practice-point admonition"><p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT<p class="last">The standard assessment tools described in this Guidance are a potentially useful way of gathering information about current clinical need and may provide a useful baseline from which to measure the benefit of any intervention. However, the findings from standard assessment tools are, on their own, not enough to inform assessment and referral decisions. Furthermore, assessment tools should only be used if clinically appropriate, and with consent from the consumer. The scores and ranges from standard assessment tools are not indicative of a diagnosis, but representative of distress, functional impairment or likelihood of a diagnosis at the time the measure was scored and is not a diagnostic assessment. <strong>Where there is significant discordance between clinician assessment and scores on standard assessment measures- this is an indicator that a comprehensive assessment is required.</strong></div></div><div class="section" id="scoring"><h4>Scoring<a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Permalink to this headline">&para;</a></h4><p><strong>0 = No problem in this domain &ndash; no descriptors apply</strong><p><strong>1 = Mild or sub diagnostic</strong><blockquote><div><ol class="loweralpha simple"><li>Currently experiencing some, but not all, of the symptoms associated with an anxiety disorder (e.g., symptoms like excessive worry, difficulty concentrating) or depressive disorder (e.g., symptoms like sadness, irritability, exhaustion, disrupted sleep, anger) that have typically been present for less than 6 months (but this may vary).

The information gathered through the initial assessment is used to assign a level of care and inform a referral decision. The levels of care are not intended to replace individualised assessment and care - rather to provide information to guide decision making.<div class="admonition-practice-point-a-note-about-consumer-choice-and-preference admonition"><p class="first admonition-title">PRACTICE POINT - A NOTE ABOUT CONSUMER CHOICE AND PREFERENCE<p>There is strong evidence to indicate that when a consumer works in partnership with a trusted health care professional and is involved in making decisions about their care and selection of the service of &lsquo;best fit&rsquo;, they are less likely to drop-out of care, and more likely to experience positive outcomes (reference). World class health care considers the choices and preferences of the individual. In a stepped care model, the individual should be given a choice within &ldquo;steps&rdquo; or within a level of care (e.g., the consumer may have a strong preference for telephone-based psychological interventions rather than face-to-face). A choice across &ldquo;steps&rdquo; or levels of care is not always practical or necessary (e.g., if the consumer does not require higher intensity supports) and this can often be resolved using supported decision-making strategies.<blockquote class="last"><div><p>Supported decision-making strategies for initial assessment and referral:<blockquote><div><ul class="simple"><li>Make sure the consumer is provided with information using their preferred way of receiving information (e.g., written/verbal/visual, English/other language, with/without a support person).<li>Make sure the consumer is provided with a list of recommended intervention options (including the option of no intervention) and encourage the consumer to contribute their own options, ideas, solutions and expectations. This might include interventions such as culturally relevant activities, or self-care strategies.<li>Ensure the consumer can express any concerns or fears about the options (e.g., cost, travel, previous positive or negative experiences).<li>Be prepared to talk about the pros and cons of each option (e.g., intensity, intervention length and commitment required, waiting periods, potential impact on symptoms).<li>Check in to ensure the consumer has understood the information provided and ensure enough time for any questions from the consumer (or carer/family member).<li>Support the decision of the consumer, acknowledging that other options can be explored in the future if this decision does not work out.</ul></div></blockquote><p>For more information and advice about supported decision-making visit: <a class="reference external" href="http://healthtalkaustralia.org/mental-health-and-supported-decision-making/">http://healthtalkaustralia.org/mental-health-and-supported-decision-making/</a> and for resources specifically for carers, visit: <a class="reference external" href="http://healthtalkaustralia.org/mental-health-carers-experiences/">http://healthtalkaustralia.org/mental-health-carers-experiences/</a></div></blockquote></div><p>Mental health services in Australia represent a complex array of service types, ranging from population-level services available to all on the internet through to highly specialised services that include short and long-term hospital care.<p>Grouping these into &lsquo;levels&rsquo; is aimed at describing a continuum of services based on <strong>levels of resource intensity</strong>. This is not intended to imply that there is natural division of service types into tiered categories. While some services are associated with a single level of care, most will appear in multiple categories. For example, GP mental health care can be associated with lower levels of care when it is provided in isolation, or higher levels when delivered in combination with other services or interventions (e.g., psychiatrist or involvement of a multidisciplinary team).<p>The levels therefore are best thought of as combinations of interventions that form potential &lsquo;packages&rsquo; for people requiring that level of care. The levels are differentiated by the amount and scope of resources available. A given individual may use some or all interventions described at that level and move between levels of care as required.<p>The core services and additional supports listed within each level of care include intervention options generally available within the mental health sector more broadly. The core services and additional supports do not represent PHN-only commissioned services. In any region, the core services and additional supports may be available through a variety of funding sources and providers.<div class="section" id="primary-mental-health-care-falls-into-levels-1-to-4"><h4>Primary mental health care falls into Levels 1 to 4<a class="headerlink" href="#primary-mental-health-care-falls-into-levels-1-to-4" title="Permalink to this headline">&para;</a></h4><blockquote><div><ul class="simple"><li>Level 1 (self-management) is suggested for those with relatively minor problems on the Primary Domains.
